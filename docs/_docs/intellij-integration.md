There is an IntelliJ plugin available for download from within IntelliJ or via the
[plugin's page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8254).

The plugin is in active development but already offers the following features:

* Live templates for quickly writing tests.
* Stacktrace folding for hiding Cuppa stack frames.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cuppa-framework/cuppa-intellij-plugin).
