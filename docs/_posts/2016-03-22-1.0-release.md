**Cuppa 1.0.0 is now available.** Check out
[the release notes](https://github.com/cuppa-framework/cuppa/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

After several months of working with Cuppa internally within ForgeRock, we feel that the API has now reached a level of
stability that we're happy to support going forwards.

There's still lots of features we want to implement, but we think now is the right time to encourage the community to
give Cuppa a try and give us feedback.

### Looking forwards

We have big plans for Cuppa.
We want it to become the de facto testing framework for Java 8.
Cuppa's goal is to make the development of tests fast and fun.

Now is a great time to get involved and help shape Cuppa's future.
If you're interested, check out the [open issues](https://github.com/cuppa-framework/cuppa/issues) and our
[contribution guide](https://github.com/cuppa-framework/cuppa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
We're especially looking for help integrating Cuppa with Gradle, Eclipse, TestNG and just about everything else.
