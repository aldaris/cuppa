**Cuppa 1.4.0 is now available.**

This release contains a new way of specifying which groups/tags to run. In addition to the existing `-Dtags=smoke test` 
and `-DexcludedTags=slow test` you can now use expressions! `-DgroupsExpression="and(or(fast,and(smoke,ui)),not(slow))"`

Additionally model class builders have been added to make construction easier, especially when cloning an existing model 
object using the new #toBuilder() methods.
