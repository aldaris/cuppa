## Mission

> We want Cuppa to become the de facto testing framework for Java.
> Cuppa's goal is to make the development of tests fast and fun.
> It is written for developers and as such must always focus on developer experience first.
> Cuppa should be as simple as possible while being fully extensible, allowing others to build great tools on top of it.
