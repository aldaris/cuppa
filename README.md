# [Cuppa](http://cuppa.forgerock.org/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cuppa-framework/cuppa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cuppa-framework/cuppa) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/cuppa-framework/cuppa/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/cuppa-framework/cuppa?branch=master)

Cuppa is a testing framework for Java 8. It makes writing tests productive and fun.

 * **Be descriptive:** Use strings – not identifiers – to clearly describe the behaviour you are testing. Test reports
 produced by Cuppa read like good documentation.
 * **Group tests together:** Create structure in your test files to reduce repetition and improve readability. Groups of
 tests can share setup and teardown steps.
 * **Define tests at runtime:** Cuppa makes it trivial to write parameterised tests. It's as simple as a <code>for</code> loop.
 Cuppa is also easy to extend - there's no need to write annotations.

## Example

```java
@Test
public class ListTest {
    {
        describe("List", () -> {
            describe("#indexOf", () -> {
                it("returns -1 when the value is not present", () -> {
                    List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
                    assertThat(list.indexOf(5)).isEqualTo(-1);
                });
            });
        });
    }
}
```

## Getting Started

For full details see [the getting started guide](http://cuppa.forgerock.org/docs/getting-started) on the
website.

#### Maven

Add a test dependency for Cuppa in your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.forgerock.cuppa</groupId>
    <artifactId>cuppa</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

See the [Maven integration guide](http://cuppa.forgerock.org/docs/maven-integration) for details on how to get Maven to
run the tests automatically.

### Plain Old Jar File

Alternatively, you can download binaries for the
[latest release](https://github.com/cuppa-framework/cuppa/releases/latest).

To run your Cuppa tests, use the Cuppa API:

```java
public class EntryPoint {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runner runner = new Runner();
        TestBlock rootBlock = runner.defineTests(Collections.singletonList(MyTestClass.class));
        runner.run(rootBlock, new DefaultReporter());
    }
}
```
